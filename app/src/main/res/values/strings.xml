Please note this refined Dropbox Folder Gallery application is not affiliated with Dropbox in any way.</string>
    <string name="permissons">\nPermissions\n\nOn first run you will be prompted to login to your Dropbox account using a browser. Then when prompted again please grant permission for the Dropbox FolderGallery profile to have read access your Dropbox folders and files. Read only access is needed to safely navigate your Dropbox folders and files.\n\nNo special Android permissions are required for Android 10 and newer to download original images. For older Android versions photos, media and file access is needed to add downloaded images to the device.\n\nThere is a bug in Android 6 reporting Overlay Permissions found - just keep re-trying until the file permission works without the overlay message. Another Android 7 bug means use an alternative viewer. eg Gallery or Downloads.</string>
    <string name="navigation">\nNavigation\n\nThe folders screen lists the folders in your dropbox top level. The Play button beside the folder name starts the display of image thumbnails below that folder. Click on a folder name to reveal its sub-folders. If a fast forward button appears please click to load more folders.\n\nThe spanner icon selects administration tools. Here you can delete cache files, and disconnect your dropbox.\n\nThe Gallery screen downloads small thumbnails in batches. Thumbnails can be sorted by file time, folder name, and file names. File names are truncated to 10 characters which is enough to distiguish a standard day date of format yyyy-mm-dd. Scroll the thumbnails up or down to see all the images.\n\nClick on a image to download the full version into the gallery storage. The image is actually placed in a special gallery album called "Dropbox Folder Gallery". Long click a thumbnail to check the image details in your dropbox storage.</string>
